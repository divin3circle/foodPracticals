              <span className="ml-6">Chili </span>sauce has a rich history that
              spans across cultures and continents. It originated in regions
              such as Mexico, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean, where chili
              peppers have long been an integral part of the local cuisine. Each
              culture has its own unique take on chili sauce, resulting in a
              wide variety of flavors and spice levels. From the smoky chipotle
              sauce of Mexico to the piquant sambal of Indonesia, chili sauce
              showcases the diverse culinary traditions around the world.It
              derives its heat and flavor from different varieties of chili
              peppers. These peppers range from mild to extra hot, offering a
              spectrum of spice for every palate. The Scoville scale is commonly
              used to measure the heat level of chili peppers, with milder
              peppers like jalapeno ranking lower and fiery peppers like the
              Carolina Reaper reaching the top of the scale. Chili sauces can be
              made from a single type of chili pepper or a blend of different
              peppers, allowing for a customized heat level and flavor profile
