          sauce is its ability to accommodate different tastes and preferences.
          If you enjoy a little heat, you can spice up your sauce with chili
          flakes or incorporate your favorite chili sauce for an added kick. For
          those who prefer a milder flavor, a touch of creamy yogurt can provide
          a delightful balance.

          sauce for crispy mozzarella sticks or as a topping for meatballs and
          sandwiches. It can even be incorporated into soups, stews, and
          simmered dishes for an extra punch of flavor.
